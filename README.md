### SLACK
Slack is an online collaboration hub that can replace email to help people work together seamlessly. Throughout the course you can reach me on Slack anytime, post to the public CS4220 channel and even get updates about what course materials have been published to this github repo.  It is much like Google Hangouts and Discord.
